        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>

        <p>
            In this part of the pathtracer project, I added onto the previous project by implementing some additional features for ray tracing.
            The two parts that I chose to complete were Part 1 (Mirror and Glass Materials) and Part 4 (Depth of Field).
        </p>

        <p>
            In the first part, I implemented BSDFs for two more materials: mirror and glass.
            I did this by adding reflection for the mirror and refraction for glass.

            For the second part, I implemented depth of field with a thin-lens model. 
            Compared to the previous model of a pinhole camera, the focus of the images changes based on focal depth and aperture.
            In my observations, the focal depth affects which part of the model is in focus, while the aperture affects the level of blurriness.
        </p>

        <p>
            I encountered a number of problems along the way, which were mainly a result of mixing up values/signs and using the wrong parameters for rendering.
            I had trouble with the glass material rendering as a mirror, which was just the result of an inverted if statement testing for total refraction.
            However, I really enjoyed working on this part of the project and was able to learn a lot about how  light interacts with different surfaces and materials for rendering.
        </p>

            Below are labeled screenshots of the scene 'CBspheres.dae' rendered with 'max_ray_depth' set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100.
            The images were sampled at 256 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light.

                Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear.

        </p>

        <p>
            At max ray depth 0, we are only able to see the top rectangular area light while the rest of the image is black/not illuminated.
        </p>

        <p>
            At max ray depth 1, the two spheres are black but have some white reflections on the top from the area light.
            The right sphere's light reflection is more grainy than the left.
            The side, floor, and back walls are also visible but the ceiling is still black.
            There are black shadows underneath the spheres.
        </p>

        <p>
            At max ray depth 2, we are now able to see ceiling illuminated.
            The sphere's shadows are lighter (grey), and there is a visible reflection in the left mirror sphere that reflects the side and floor walls and right sphere.
            In the right sphere, there is a very faint reflection of the walls.
        </p>

        <p>
            At max ray depth 3, we can now see the glass details in the right sphere, which reflects the right purple wall on the left side.The shadow of the right sphere has a white circle in the middle.
            The ceiling is also visible now the left mirror sphere, as the light from the ceiling was able to bounce off other surfaces and onto the ceiling wall.

        </p>

        <p>
            At max ray depth 4, we can observe that the reflection of the right sphere in the left sphere now has color and more details.
            The values in the image also appear brighter.


        </p>

        <p>
            At max ray depth 5, the image gets brighter overall, and the shadows are less harsh/dark.
        </p>

        <p>
            At max ray depth 100, there is the less noise. The colors appear brighter and the shadows are more diffused and less harsh.

        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, a pattern that I can observe about the bounce numbers and multibounce effects of each image is that the number of details and "illuminated" objects/features increases with higher ray depths.
            In addition, with more bounces, the overall image becomes brighter as it is more illuminated.

        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <p>
            In this part, I implemented depth of field using a thin-lens camera model (opposed to the original pinhole camera model).
            The difference between these two types of camera models is that for a pinhole camera, the entire image is in focus.
            However, for a thin-lens camera, the focus of the image is dependent on aperture and focal distance.
            In this model, we have to account for the direction of the ray changing once it passes through the lens rather than going straight through a pinhole.
            Rather than the origin being (0, 0, 0), the lens can receive radiance from any point on the lens.

            As shown in the focus stack, the image is blurry when the focal depth is at 3.5. 
            At 4.5, the front of the dragon is in focus, while the rest is blurry.
            At 5.0, the back furthest part of the dragon is in focus while the rest is blurry. 
            At a focal depth of 5.5, the entire image is blurry again.

        <p>
            With the various aperture sizes above, we can see how an image becomes more blurry at a higher aperture.
            The dragon image is most in focus at the lowest aperature of 0.23.
            However, as the aperature increases, the dragon becomes increasingly blurry.
